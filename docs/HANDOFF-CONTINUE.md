# ScriptCraft — continuation brief (current as of v6.43 — READ docs/SPEED-AUDIT-2026-07-28.md §3 before verifying anything; NOTE the isolate:false revert in §2)

> READ FIRST — v4.84 fixed a v4.81 bug worth learning from: the window
> shape-memory was written correctly and then OVERWRITTEN by the dock-row
> click handler (`setToolMode(id,'docked')` on every open), so the
> commonest way to reopen a tool erased the memory. My driver had tested
> the Tools MENU path and passed; Derek hit the panel-row path. When a
> feature has several entry points, drive the one the user actually
> uses — the rule now lives in ToolDock's `openFromRow`: opening READS
> the mode, only explicit gestures WRITE it.


> QUEUE — NEXT UP (Derek, 2026-07-31, verbatim): **ONE PRESET EXPORT
> WINDOW.** "I want to combine all of the various preset exports into one
> tool. this is how it will work: anywhere in the app, if you click export
> theme preset, export settings preset, export workspace... whatever you
> choose, they all lead to the same preset export window. In this window,
> there is a checklist of all the various things that can be exported as
> presets: workspaces, themes, settings, etc. You check which of these you
> want to include, and it exports a single file holding the info for the
> presets for each of the items you selected."
> Build notes: utils/presets.ts (v4.79) is the foundation — it already
> compiles customizations/full-preset/themes/outline-presets and owns the
> `_<type>.json` filename rule, and PresetsPanel/PresetsDialog is the
> File ▸ Export ▸ Presets window. What this spec ADDS: (a) a per-category
> CHECKLIST producing ONE combined file (a bundle format with per-section
> keys — version it), (b) WORKSPACES as an exportable category (not in the
> v4.79 set; snapshots live in workspacesSlice/viewState), (c) EVERY
> scattered export door (ThemesTab, outline presets, Settings ▸ Backup,
> Customize footer, any workspace export) OPENS THIS WINDOW instead of
> running its own flow — a door may PRE-CHECK its own category but they all
> land in the one window. Import side: Derek's spec covers EXPORT; ask (or
> spec separately) whether import becomes the mirror-image checklist of the
> combined file before building that half.

> QUEUE — WAITING on Derek: the ribbon default preset (he will send a Full
> Preset export to bake in as the shipped defaults). Otherwise clear; the
> standing what's-left:
> 1. **Tauri fs scope** — the one audit item deliberately NOT shipped.
>    Full plan + Derek's 6-step desktop test list in
>    docs/AUDIT-2026-07-26.md §3 (v4.82 follow-up). It rewrites the save
>    path and cannot be tested in this sandbox — give it its own session.
> 2. Derek's unanswered question (asked v4.78): which EXTRA Guided Setup
>    steps he wants — page layout, autosave/backup, theme-with-preview,
>    template preview, start-from-an-existing-script.
> 3. Older backlog, untouched: #20 editorStore chrome slice, #21
>    ScreenplayEditor hooks split, #22 MenuBar/Toolbar/CharacterProfiles
>    split, #23 Modal/PopupMenu shells + dead-CSS pass.
> 1. NEW-SCRIPT LAUNCHER + GUIDED SETUP WIZARD (Derek's big feature,
>    late v4.78 session — his spec verbatim in the chat): a first window
>    with four options — New Script (Manual Setup) / New Script (Guided
>    Setup) / Open Script / Import File. Manual = the current new-script
>    window PLUS a save-locations field defaulting to the most recently
>    updated script's locations; Open/Import leave that window (they
>    live on the launcher now). Guided = a wizard: Project Naming, Save
>    locations & options, Format options, then a friendly page per
>    Customize tab (NOT the raw tabs — explanation text, user-friendly),
>    each with Next and "Skip for now", plus a persistent note "all of
>    these options can be changed at a later time". MUST stay in sync
>    with Customize (single source — read the same stores/registries,
>    never copies). Claude suggested additions pending Derek's pick (see
>    the v4.78 delivery message): a page-layout step, autosave/backup
>    step, theme step, template preview, an "import settings from
>    another script" step.
>    PLUS (Derek, same session): Customize window footer gains Import /
>    Export Customizations — export writes a file of every customization
>    choice; import applies it after a warning ("this will override all
>    of your current customization settings"). Both Manual and Guided
>    setup offer "customize from file": pick a customize file OR an
>    existing ScriptCraft file and copy its customization settings.
>    Foundations: utils/settingsBackup (v4.22 whole-settings export) and
>    the workspaces customize snapshot — scope a CUSTOMIZATIONS-only
>    subset of that, one schema shared by Customize footer + both setups.
> 2. Window-mode memory incl. FULLSCREEN (deferred from v4.78, reason:
>    touches openTool/dock/persist semantics across many flows — needs
>    fresh-session care): every tool reopens in its last shape — side
>    panel / floating / fullscreen. v4.78 already shipped the fullscreen
>    header's shrink button (left of ×, → floating) and closed-row
>    drag-out; what remains is persisting 'fullscreen' as a remembered
>    mode and honoring it in openTool/dock clicks.
> 3. Audit items: rescans gated on tool-open (live open / refresh on open /
>    idle closed); react-router major bump; Tauri fs $HOME scope narrowing;
>    CSP decision documented.
> FINDINGS standing: (a) File ▸ Print is window.print() and 16-print.css
>    hides every .page-sep overlay — printed output has NO page numbers/
>    headers/footers; PDF export is the numbered path. Fixing print = its
>    own project. (b) About ▸ Compatibility = runtime capability probes
>    (services/compat.ts): UUID/SubtleCrypto/Clipboard are always
>    "Latest" in the desktop app; the Storage row is the only
>    informative one. Recommended: fold into a Diagnostics surface or
>    trim — awaiting Derek's call.

Read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/HANDOFF.md` first for the durable footguns, the architecture
map, and Derek's working style. **This file is the fresh-chat catch-up**: the exact
commit/deploy workflow, what shipped in the last run, the best practices learned while
fixing this run's bugs, and where development stands — so a new session picks up without
re-deriving it. When it drifts, **rewrite it** (don't just append).

> Why this exists: chats grow long and slow. Starting fresh keeps each turn fast; this
> doc + `CLAUDE.md` carry everything forward.

## 0. THE WORKFLOW — how a change reaches Derek's Mac (read this first)

You are **not** editing Derek's Mac. You run in a **remote sandbox with its own fresh
clone**. The only channel to Derek is **git push**. He never copies files, never runs a
build — he runs **one command** and your pushed commits arrive.

**The contract, every single change:**

1. Edit files in this sandbox.
2. Run the gates (below). They must pass.
3. `git commit` with a clear message + the trailers (below).
4. `git push -u origin claude/v0_32`
5. End your delivery message with exactly:
   ```
   cd /Users/dcarl/ScriptCraft && npm run desktop
   ```

That's it. **`npm run desktop` = restore `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` (v5.55: his local
`tauri dev` rewrites that generated file; a dirty copy aborted `git pull` — the
committed lockfile is canonical) → `git pull` → `npm install` (no-op unless deps
changed) → launch the Tauri app.** So the instant you've pushed to `claude/v0_32`, Derek runs that
one command and sees your change. If you didn't push, he gets nothing — pushing **is**
the deploy.

### Branch, remote, gotchas
- **Branch: `claude/v0_32`.** It is what Derek's clone tracks and what `npm run desktop`
  pulls. This is the current branch and its upstream is `origin/claude/v0_32`, so a plain
  `git push -u origin claude/v0_32` is all you need (single branch — no dual-push in this
  environment).
- **Remote in this environment is the `dac8767/ScriptCraft` path** (via the sandbox
  proxy) and it works. (An older handoff said the ScriptCraft path 403s and to use the
  `FreeScript` path — that was a *different* environment. Trust `git remote -v` in your
  own sandbox; here it's ScriptCraft and pushes succeed.)
- **Never commit to `main`** (stale v0.6 baseline). **Never force-push** `v0_32`.
- **Push retries:** on a network error, retry up to 4× with backoff (2s/4s/8s/16s).
- **Do NOT open a PR** unless Derek explicitly asks. The workflow is push-to-branch, not PR.
- **Model identity:** never put the model id in commits, code, changelog, or PR bodies —
  chat replies only. Commit trailers:
  ```
  Co-Authored-By: <the model trailer your environment instructions give>
  Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_...
  ```

### The gates — run before claiming anything works
```bash
cd frontend
npx tsc -b        # MUST be 0 errors. It gates the .dmg build; an unused import breaks the release.
npm test          # 605 tests as of this run, all green
npm run build     # tsc -b && vite build — must succeed
```
Bash resets to the repo root each call, so `cd frontend` every time (or chain with `&&`).
Write a real regression test for anything with logic — this repo's habit is "render it
and read back what it produced," which is how its worst bugs were caught.

### Versioning — the per-batch rule
Every shipped batch bumps `APP_VERSION` in `frontend/src/data/changelog.ts` and adds a
newest-first entry to `frontend/src/data/changelog.json` (the `changes: […]` string
shape) **in the same commit**, then gets its §1 section here. One batch = one version =
one changelog entry = one §1 section.

---

## 0.5 Multi-worker strategy — read `docs/WORKERS.md` (the playbook)

**Tier 1 (DEFAULT, proven): in-chat parallel workers.** The Dispatcher (this
chat) spawns N background subagents via the Agent tool — in ONE message so they
run concurrently — each with a tight brief on a disjoint lane. Workers never run
gates (concurrent tsc/vitest clobber shared state) and never commit; the
Dispatcher reviews diffs, runs the three gates once, live-verifies, commits,
pushes. Derek talks to one chat.

**Tier 2 (scale-out, use with care): fresh-session Routine spawns** — one at a
time, heartbeat-first prompts, standalone checkout preamble (fresh clones sit on
stale `main` with the WRONG CLAUDE.md), permissions via the committed
`.claude/settings.json`. The 2026-07-24 double-spawn produced two silently dead
sessions; `docs/WORKERS.md` has the derived operating rules. **Path B** (Derek
pastes briefs into chats himself) is the always-works fallback.

Lane infrastructure (all tiers): `docs/AREA-MAP.md` (lane map + spine),
`docs/lanes.json` (file→lane truth), `scripts/check-lanes.mjs`
(`npm run check-lanes`; `plan <lanes...>`; `--selftest` after edits),
`docs/EFFICIENCY-AUDIT.md` (cleanup backlog).

**Standing instruction:** when Derek queues more than one update, classify each
into a lane, run the planner, spawn Tier-1 workers for parallel-safe lanes, keep
spine work in the Dispatcher, and report the wave plan before starting.

---

## 0.6 Done phases — slicing, coverage, splits (history in HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md)

The editorStore slicing (10 domains; chrome deliberately deferred), the
safe-progress/coverage phase (suite 343 → 605 tests; the working-notes export
leak found & fixed across all four exporters; the workspaces apply root-cause)
and the first component splits are DONE. Their full write-ups moved verbatim to
`docs/HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md` (§0.6/§0.7) — read them there BEFORE reworking those
areas; the durable rules they produced live in CLAUDE.md §4 and §2 below.

Durable bits kept live here:
- Any test that (even transitively) imports `editorStore` needs
  `// @vitest-environment jsdom` (the store touches localStorage at import).
  Single-file `npx vitest run <file>` can resolve a cached vitest without jsdom
  and die with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND — re-run the full suite before believing a
  weird worker failure.
- Still open from those phases (needs Derek): his list of WHICH Design-panel
  options "never worked"; deliberate minor nits (odraft meta value-type
  validation, fonts loadFont failure-retry, templateCss selector escaping).

---

## 1. Where we are right now (end of this run)

> **STANDING RULE — start EVERY turn with `git fetch origin claude/v0_32 &&
> git log --oneline -1 origin/claude/v0_32`, and if local HEAD differs,
> `git reset --hard origin/claude/v0_32` BEFORE reading or editing anything.**
> The sandbox has now rolled back to a stale snapshot TWICE mid-session
> (v4.28-era files reappearing while origin was fine). Symptom: a file shows
> long-deleted code. The remote is the truth; pushes always survived.

> **STANDING SIZE CAP (2026-07-28 token-efficiency batch):** §1 keeps only
> the LAST 4–5 version sections fully written. When you add a new one, move
> the oldest kept section VERBATIM to the top of the version list in
> `docs/HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md` and add its one-liner to the index below. This
> file is read at the start of every fresh session — its length is a
> per-session tax. It was allowed to reach 2,559 lines; don't let it again.

### v6.43 — the print crash's TRUE root cause; Settings→File; standard window buttons

- PRINT CRASH ROUND 3 (survived v6.37): ROOT CAUSE — a LIFETIME bug, not
  threading/exceptions. `runOperationModalForWindow…` presents the sheet
  ASYNCHRONOUSLY and returns at once; the closure then dropped the
  `Retained<NSPrintOperation>`, so the runloop presented a sheet for a
  DEALLOCATED operation → SIGSEGV (no ObjC exception involved — nothing
  for catch to catch, no dialog ever visible; matches Derek's symptom
  exactly). Fix: a main-thread `thread_local!` slot `ACTIVE_PRINT` keeps
  (op, doc) alive until the NEXT print replaces them. Type-checked on
  aarch64-apple-darwin via the scratch crate (scratchpad/print-check —
  exception::catch omitted there, its C shim needs Apple's toolchain);
  Linux cargo check clean. RULE, recorded: any AppKit API that presents
  asynchronously needs its objects kept alive past the presenting call.
  NOT runnable in this sandbox — if Derek STILL crashes, ask for the
  macOS crash log (Console.app ▸ Crash Reports) before theorizing again.
- Settings…: OUT of the macOS app menu (reverses v4.22), INTO File as
  the SECOND-TO-LAST item (Script History stays last), both menu modes —
  nativeMenuSync mirrors MenuBar's one list. ⌘, moved to the shortcut
  REGISTRY (shortcuts.ts defaultCombo 'Mod+,') — the app-menu item had
  hardcoded it.
- FloatingWindow (Settings + Helper Text) buttons = THE standard set:
  char-profiles-fullscreen-btn + FullscreenIcon (RestoreIcon while
  fullscreen), tool-window-close + CloseIcon — Derek's screenshot caught
  the Lu-icon lookalikes. check-v638/v642 assert the SVG family now
  (close count is exactly one).
- check-v642 gained the File-menu-tail assert (scope to the ROOT
  .menu-dropdown — a submenu flyout is a second one).

### v6.42 — LOCAL-FIRST: account/cloud UI purged; Settings is a WINDOW

- Derek's seven (plus a mid-turn rename). The decisive read: his items
  2/4/5 flagged the ACCOUNT surfaces v6.40 deliberately kept ("I think
  this refers to the now disabled collaboration server") — the answer is
  they were the account system, and they're gone from the UI anyway:
  no sign-in affordance may remain. SERVICE LAYER KEPT in code
  (collabAuth api, cloudApi, authedFetch, scriptApi cloud routing,
  authVerified/collabAuth store fields, /verify /reset-password logic is
  DELETED though) — UI-less, so nothing can arm it. Revert = git.
- REMOVED: SettingsPage rewritten (System tab = Reset only; Cloud Server
  URL + ScriptCraft Account + Account & Security gone, plus the Google
  Identity helpers); Save Options' account section + BOTH Cloud rows;
  setupFields' ScriptCraft Cloud row; SaveAs 'ScriptCraft Cloud' chip;
  StatusBar Cloud mirror + AuthIndicator; AuthGate/AuthBootstrap
  unmounted; files deleted: AuthGate, AuthBootstrap, AuthIndicator,
  CollabLoginDialog, VerifyEmailRoute, ResetPasswordRoute (+their
  routes); OpenFile's This device/Cloud tabs (app=local, web=cloud-only
  — both single-source); saveLocations lost saveToCloudMirror + cloud
  snapshot branch; settingsStore lost saveToCloud/snapToCloud (+keys);
  login CSS culled (auth-indicator cluster, 53 dead settings/collab
  rules). /oauth-callback STAYS — it's the GDrive/OneDrive PKCE popup
  lander, NOT account UI.
- Always-on row: shows + edits localSaveFolder (THE Save As field — one
  source, two doors) with Choose Folder…; checkbox stays locked.
- Auto saves: the local-folder branch writes `<folder>/Auto Saves/…`;
  save_text_to_path (lib.rs) now create_dir_all's parents (cargo check
  clean). GDrive/OneDrive already used an Auto Saves folder.
- Settings window: PreferencesDialog swapped Modal for FloatingWindow —
  NEW shared shell extracted from HelperTextWindow's v6.38 chrome (drag,
  any-edge EdgeResizeZones, fullscreen, close; htw-* classes are the
  shared window classes now). HelperTextWindow consumes it too (one
  shell, no fork). prefs-window CSS: layout flexes, inputs re-enable
  user-select.
- Annotations: "Filter" → "Display" (label + title only — the
  markup-ctl-filter class and data-ctl="filter" are persisted/check ids
  and keep their names; every check selects by class, verified).
- check-v642 (16 asserts: window chrome/drag/fullscreen, no account/
  cloud anywhere, chip = localSaveFolder, System=Reset, Display label,
  Auto Saves path). v638 re-run 19/0 (shared shell holds).

### v6.41 — Save Options unlocked + backup location; toolbar toggle retired

- Derek: (1) "OneDrive is locked as a save location even though I haven't
  connected" — ROOT CAUSE: setup's SaveLocationsField has NO connection
  guard (tick anything), but PreferencesDialog's rows wore
  `disabled={!connected}` — written to stop ENABLING unconnected
  providers, it also blocked DISABLING one. All five guards removed
  (gdrive/onedrive save; cloud/gdrive/onedrive snapshots); the "— connect
  below first" label hints stay. An enabled-but-unconnected provider
  fails through the save-error surface (reportSaveError), not silently.
- (2) "Local System (backup location)": settingsStore gains
  saveToBackupFolder (bool) + backupSaveFolder (path) — SEPARATE so
  unchecking keeps the folder (keys opendraft:saveloc:saveToBackupFolder
  / :backupFolder; settingsBackup picks them up by prefix scan).
  mirrorSave adds job 'Local backup' gated on BOTH (checkbox alone can't
  arm a write into nowhere) reusing saveToLocalFolder(payload, folder).
  Prefs row = the v2.83 snapshot-folder pattern (check-with-no-folder
  opens the picker, path chip, Choose Folder…). SaveAsDialog's chips
  include 'Local backup' under the same gate (tested).
- (3) "Show/Hide Annotations" toolbar button REMOVED: the
  toolbarBuiltins row is deleted — normalizeToolbarZones DROPS unknown
  b: tokens, so saved layouts shed it on next normalize; Toolbar's case +
  uiIcons entry gone; helper catalog regenerated. Visibility still lives
  in annotationsMenu + the Annotations window's Show button.
- NOTE (scout finding, not acted on): localSaveFolder ('This device'
  mirror, set via Save As/setup) still has NO row in Save Options, and
  StatusBar's enabledMirrors ignores both local mirrors — pre-existing
  gaps, flag to Derek if he wants them surfaced.

### v6.40 — Collaboration REMOVED (Derek: "remove all Collaborate or Collaboration Server functionality")

- THE LINE THAT MATTERS: `collabAuth`/`CollabLoginDialog`/`/auth/*` are the
  ACCOUNT system (Cloud saves, sign-in, 2FA, devices) — the identity
  provider merely began life on the collab server, and the names + the
  `opendraft:collabAuth` storage key STAY (renaming orphans signed-in
  users). Everything session/share/sync is GONE.
- Deleted: hooks/useCollaboration, services/collabSync, ShareDialog,
  JoinCollabDialog, backend app/api/collab.py + services/collab_service.py,
  start_collab.sh, user-manual/collaboration.html (+ sidebar/nav links),
  COLLAB_COLORS. ScreenplayEditor lost the /collab/:token route (App.tsx
  too), banner, start/stop/switch/join handlers, collabExtensions
  (History is unconditional now — line was `...(collabMode ? ...)`),
  editorKey (only collab set it), isCollabGuest guards (~12 sites).
  MenuBar lost the File ▸ Collaboration submenu + guest disables;
  showUnreleasedTools stays (Lock Pages still reads it).
- Settings: "Collaboration Server" + "Invite Defaults" sections gone
  (SettingsPage); account sections retitled "ScriptCraft Account"
  (SettingsPage + PreferencesDialog; save row now "Cloud - ScriptCraft
  Account"). settingsStore lost collabServerUrl + defaultInviteExpiry
  (+ their opendraft:* keys); config.ts lost getCollabWsUrl.
- collabAuth.ts kept ONLY the account api (register/login/2FA/devices/
  getServerConfig via the backend proxy); collabRequest/testConnection/
  reset-close-document/revokeMyCollabSessions/isCollabAuthenticated/
  setLogoutCollabTeardown removed; performLogout is 3 steps now. The four
  storage adapters dropped the 5 collab methods + CollabSession in
  lockstep (api/local-storage/fallback/file-fallback).
- npm: @hocuspocus/provider, @tiptap/extension-collaboration{,-cursor},
  yjs, y-prosemirror, y-protocols uninstalled → About's open-source list
  dropped Yjs & Hocuspocus (v4.76 standing rule). Helper catalog
  REGENERATED (dialog strings left). CSS: collab blocks out of 16-print/
  15-responsive/17-settings (login dialog's .collab-forgot-link/.collab-
  remember-* stay — account UI). Tests 1103→1102 (randomCollabColor).
- collab-server/ is now an AUTH-ONLY server (server.ts rewritten:
  no Hocuspocus/Yjs/ws/upgrade path, /api/collab + reset/close-document
  gone; /auth + /health stay; deps ws/yjs/@hocuspocus/* dropped;
  `tsc --noEmit` verified). deploy/ configs still name the service
  "collab" — renaming the service id across compose/Caddy/supervisord
  was deliberately NOT done (infra rename, no behavior change).
- lanes.json "collab" lane → "Auth / Cloud / Settings" minus deleted
  files. If Derek ever wants collaboration back: `git log` around
  v6.39→v6.40, it's one revert away plus npm install.

### v6.39 — map rotation unlocked; the map is a CANVAS now (WKWebView)

- Derek: (1) remove the import bar ("Turn the map upright…", Rotate, Set
  Rotation) — rotation is changeable in Options now; (2) "rotating the
  map in the location window still makes it disappear" (SURVIVED v6.38's
  160px floor on his Mac).
- (2) ROOT CAUSE UNREACHABLE IN CHROMIUM: probes rendered the CSS
  quarter-turn correctly in docked AND fullscreen shapes, so the vanish
  is WKWebView mishandling the construct (absolute box-swap +
  translate(-50%,-50%) rotate()). Fix: MapImage DRAWS the bitmap onto a
  dpr-scaled canvas (translate/rotate/drawImage, quarter-swapped draw
  box) — no CSS transform left to mis-render. Bytes load via
  api.getAssetBytes → blob URL (AssetImage's rule) with callback refs
  (v6.38's refetch lesson); a failed load unmounts to the broken box and
  a rotation remounts = retry. `.locmap-img` is the canvas now — checks
  wait on `canvas.locmap-img` (the loading box shares the stage's 4/3).
- (1) `importing` gates, lockLocationMapRotation, the import bar and its
  CSS are GONE; importLocationMap + the asset picker set
  rotationLocked: true (the field is vestigial — saved scripts carry it,
  nothing reads it). Pins render and place from the first moment.
  rotateLocationMap already turned pins with the map (v5.81) — that's
  what makes any-time rotation safe.
- Checks v577 (rotate flow = Options ▸ Rotate 90 degrees ×4),
  v578/v581/v581-orphan/v582 (×4 sites)/v585: the import-bar setup step
  became waitForSelector('canvas.locmap-img'). All green + v638.

### Older versions — one line each (full sections in `docs/HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md`)

Newest first. When a version rolls out of the detailed set above, its section
moves verbatim to the archive and its line lands here.

### Standing release blockers (unchanged; from CLAUDE.md §6 / HANDOFF.md §5)
Brand art (`src-tauri/icons/`, splash, favicon); Apple Developer + signing identity in
`build-desktop.sh`; rehost `languageCatalog.ts` dictionaries off Proteus's CDN; Courier
Prime + dictionary licenses; trademark clearance on "ScriptCraft"; `macos-private-api` is
on ⇒ no Mac App Store (the signed-`.dmg` plan); rotate the embedded GitHub PAT.

---

## 2. Best practices & footguns learned THIS run (add to the ones in CLAUDE.md §4)

These each cost a bug. They're specific to what this run touched.

- **Assets on desktop can't be `fetch()`ed.** Derek runs the Tauri SQLite backend, whose
  `getAssetUrl` returns a `convertFileSrc` `asset://…` URL — the webview loads it fine via
  `<img src>` but **cannot `fetch()` it**, so a blob-loader that fetched the URL showed a
  broken "!". Fix pattern, now the rule: **every storage backend exposes `getAssetBytes`;
  load bytes → `URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([bytes]))`.** Works on desktop *and* web.
  `AssetImage` / `AssetAudio` in `CharacterProfiles.tsx` are the reference.
- **Two lists that drift = the Remove bug.** The character panel drew names from the
  store's `characters` list, which goes stale the instant a cue is deleted
  (`updateCharacters` only re-runs when the cursor leaves a character node). So a deleted
  profile got resurrected. Fix, and the general rule: **derive from one fresh source.** The
  panel now scans the live doc (`scriptCharacterNames`) as the single source of "who's in
  the script"; the stale store list is not a source for it. (This is CLAUDE.md's
  single-source-of-truth rule biting in practice — believe it.)
- **Flex `flex: 0 0 auto` moves the shrink pressure, it doesn't remove it.** Making ribbon
  sections non-shrinking (so the bar scrolls instead of squishing) meant *all* the
  narrow-window shrink fell on the separators (still `flex-shrink: 1`) → they collapsed to
  0 width and the dividers vanished. **When you pin one set of flex children, pin the
  siblings that must keep their size too.** Now both sections and separators are
  `flex: 0 0 auto`; nothing shrinks, the bar scrolls.
- **Ribbon overflow model:** the toolbar used to hide low-priority sections into a "…"
  menu on narrow widths (that reads as "squishing"). It now **scrolls horizontally**
  (`overflow-x: auto` + non-shrinking children). The overflow menu is kept **only** for
  genuinely CSS-hidden (mobile-only, `offsetWidth === 0`) items so those stay reachable on
  phones. Don't reintroduce width-based hiding.
- **Making a floating window dockable = extract a body, share it.** Pattern used three
  times this run (Design, Workspaces, Feedback): pull the panel's guts into a
  `…Body`/`…Docked` component with no chrome, render it from both the floating window and a
  new `ToolDock` case, so the two entry points can't drift. To register a dockable tool:
  add the id to `ToolId` (`stores/editorStore.ts`), add an `ALL_TOOLS` entry + a render
  `case` in `ToolDock.tsx`; it then appears in **Customize > Side Panels** automatically
  (it's built from `ALL_TOOLS` minus `PANEL_EXCLUDED_IDS`). Give width-hungry surfaces
  `noPanelFit: true` so they open floating but still pop-in-dock.
- **Portalled toolbar slot = line one panel's controls up with another's.** The
  relationship map's action bar renders via `createPortal` into a `.char-rels-toolbar`
  `<div>` that CharacterProfiles owns (passed as `headerSlot`), so the map's Fit/Add
  buttons sit in the *same place and style* as the list view's toolbar. A `useState`
  element + ref-callback is the wiring (`setMapHeaderSlot`).
- **File-tab CSS trick:** tabs get `border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0`, `margin-bottom: -1px` to
  overlap the track's bottom border, and the **active** tab gets
  `border-bottom: 1px solid <content-bg>` (here `--fd-navigator-bg`) to *mask* the track
  line so it visually merges with the panel below. That's what makes them read as real
  tabs, not underlined text.
- **Design tokens are gated by a test.** Each token in `design/designTokens.ts` must have
  `def` equal to the CSS `var(--x, <fallback>)` literal it drives (a unit test enforces
  it). New knob this run: `charFieldGap` / `--dz-char-field-gap`, def `8`, and every CSS
  use writes `var(--dz-char-field-gap, 8px)`. Keep them in lockstep or `npm test` fails.
- **Persisted character data rides the whole profile object.** `voiceProfile`,
  `customFields`, etc. persist automatically because `_characterProfiles` serializes the
  full `characterProfiles` array (save sites in `ScreenplayEditor.tsx` +
  `MenuBar.tsx`; load spreads the full object; `collabSync` syncs the whole array). Add a
  field to the `CharacterProfile` type and it just persists — no per-field plumbing.

## 3. Architecture pointers for what this run touched

| File | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `components/CharacterProfiles.tsx` | The character tool. Tabs (`activeTab`: profiles/relationships/setup), `relViewMode` (list/map), `AssetImage`/`AssetAudio`, name-rewrite-into-script, Setup tab, custom fields. Big file — the whole tool. |
| `components/RelationshipMap.tsx` | SVG force-graph. Its toolbar (Fit + Add Relationship) **portals into `headerSlot`**; pan/zoom hint is a bottom-left corner overlay. |
| `components/ToolDock.tsx` | `ALL_TOOLS` registry + the render `switch`. Add dockable tools here. `WINDOW_IDS`, `PANEL_EXCLUDED_IDS`. |
| `components/DesignPanel.tsx` | `DesignPanelBody` (shared guts) + `DesignPanelDocked` + the floating `DesignPanel`. |
| `components/WorkspacesTool.tsx`, `FeedbackTool.tsx` | The new dockable tools. Feedback reads `data/helpForms.ts`. |
| `components/Toolbar.tsx` + `styles/screenplay/03-toolbar.css` | The ribbon. Overflow → scroll logic in `measure()`; `.rib-section` / `.toolbar-separator` are `flex: 0 0 auto`. |
| `stores/editorStore.ts` | `ToolId` (add dockable ids here), `CharacterProfile` type, character store actions. ~2.6k lines. |
| `design/designTokens.ts` | Design-knob registry; `def` must equal the CSS var fallback. |
| `styles/screenplay/10-character-profiles.css` | All character-tool styling. |

**The stylesheet is already split** into `styles/screenplay/NN-*.css` area files (that
was the long-planned `screenplay.css` split; it happened). Character = `10-…`, toolbar =
`03-…`, tools-extra = `22-…`, design panel = `26-…`, toolbar-zones = `23-…`.

## 4. UI verification — USE THE KIT (speed audit 2026-07-28)

**Start from `frontend/devtools/driver.mjs`** — launch/boot/seedScript/openTool/
fullscreen/waitScenes/shot, all event-waited. Derek timed the old way at 11
minutes per small update; the kit reaches the same verified state **31× faster**
(measured 108.4s → 3.5s, `devtools/bench-boot.mjs` reproduces it). The rules
live in `docs/SPEED-AUDIT-2026-07-28.md` §3; the short form:

- **Never type a fixture** — `seedScript()` injects the whole document through
  the DEV-only `window.__scEditor` handle (ScreenplayEditor, DEV builds only).
- **Never `waitForTimeout` on a guess** — wait on a named condition.
- **One driver run prints every number** you need; re-running is ~4s but the
  habit matters.
- Iterate with `npx vitest related <files> --run` (~3s); the **full suite once,
  before commit** (~12s since `isolate: false`; if a failure smells like
  cross-file leakage, re-check with `--isolate`).
- Driver scripts and fixtures live in `frontend/devtools/`, IN THE REPO — a
  rollback wiped the scratchpad copies mid-audit.

Environment facts that still hold:
- Chromium at `executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`; dev server
  `npx vite --port 5199` (curl-poll for 200). Don't run `playwright install`.
- Startup dialogs block the UI — `boot()` Escapes them; clicking **Create** on
  the New Script dialog also works if you drive by hand.
- Open Customize via `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('scriptcraft:command', { detail: 'customize' }))`.
- Seed chrome state via `localStorage['opendraft:viewState']` in `addInitScript`;
  to keep a seeded ribbon verbatim, also set the one-time migration flags
  (`opendraft:toolbar*NNN`).
- Tools render **inline** by default (`.tool-inline-*`); clicking `.ProseMirror`
  **minimizes** an open tool window (by design).

## 5. Derek, in one paragraph

Sole product owner and tester; tests each build on his Mac and reports back. Wants **root
cause, not patches**; **one source of truth** for anything that appears twice; **no silent
no-ops**; honest risk assessment (defer with a reason, own mistakes plainly). He renames
things constantly — rename everywhere, immediately. Icons are monotone line-style, never
emoji in UI chrome. Never comment on the time of day. He iterates fast on visual
placement, so a reasonable attempt he can correct beats stalling — **but** don't invent
*content/behavior* decisions (a genre taxonomy, what a new control does); ask for those.
End every delivery with `cd /Users/dcarl/ScriptCraft && npm run desktop`.
