# ScriptCraft — continuation brief (current as of v5.51 — READ docs/SPEED-AUDIT-2026-07-28.md §3 before verifying anything; NOTE the isolate:false revert in §2)

> READ FIRST — v4.84 fixed a v4.81 bug worth learning from: the window
> shape-memory was written correctly and then OVERWRITTEN by the dock-row
> click handler (`setToolMode(id,'docked')` on every open), so the
> commonest way to reopen a tool erased the memory. My driver had tested
> the Tools MENU path and passed; Derek hit the panel-row path. When a
> feature has several entry points, drive the one the user actually
> uses — the rule now lives in ToolDock's `openFromRow`: opening READS
> the mode, only explicit gestures WRITE it.


> QUEUE — WAITING on Derek: the ribbon default preset (he will send a Full
> Preset export to bake in as the shipped defaults). Otherwise clear; the
> standing what's-left:
> 1. **Tauri fs scope** — the one audit item deliberately NOT shipped.
>    Full plan + Derek's 6-step desktop test list in
>    docs/AUDIT-2026-07-26.md §3 (v4.82 follow-up). It rewrites the save
>    path and cannot be tested in this sandbox — give it its own session.
> 2. Derek's unanswered question (asked v4.78): which EXTRA Guided Setup
>    steps he wants — page layout, autosave/backup, theme-with-preview,
>    template preview, start-from-an-existing-script.
> 3. Older backlog, untouched: #20 editorStore chrome slice, #21
>    ScreenplayEditor hooks split, #22 MenuBar/Toolbar/CharacterProfiles
>    split, #23 Modal/PopupMenu shells + dead-CSS pass.
> 1. NEW-SCRIPT LAUNCHER + GUIDED SETUP WIZARD (Derek's big feature,
>    late v4.78 session — his spec verbatim in the chat): a first window
>    with four options — New Script (Manual Setup) / New Script (Guided
>    Setup) / Open Script / Import File. Manual = the current new-script
>    window PLUS a save-locations field defaulting to the most recently
>    updated script's locations; Open/Import leave that window (they
>    live on the launcher now). Guided = a wizard: Project Naming, Save
>    locations & options, Format options, then a friendly page per
>    Customize tab (NOT the raw tabs — explanation text, user-friendly),
>    each with Next and "Skip for now", plus a persistent note "all of
>    these options can be changed at a later time". MUST stay in sync
>    with Customize (single source — read the same stores/registries,
>    never copies). Claude suggested additions pending Derek's pick (see
>    the v4.78 delivery message): a page-layout step, autosave/backup
>    step, theme step, template preview, an "import settings from
>    another script" step.
>    PLUS (Derek, same session): Customize window footer gains Import /
>    Export Customizations — export writes a file of every customization
>    choice; import applies it after a warning ("this will override all
>    of your current customization settings"). Both Manual and Guided
>    setup offer "customize from file": pick a customize file OR an
>    existing ScriptCraft file and copy its customization settings.
>    Foundations: utils/settingsBackup (v4.22 whole-settings export) and
>    the workspaces customize snapshot — scope a CUSTOMIZATIONS-only
>    subset of that, one schema shared by Customize footer + both setups.
> 2. Window-mode memory incl. FULLSCREEN (deferred from v4.78, reason:
>    touches openTool/dock/persist semantics across many flows — needs
>    fresh-session care): every tool reopens in its last shape — side
>    panel / floating / fullscreen. v4.78 already shipped the fullscreen
>    header's shrink button (left of ×, → floating) and closed-row
>    drag-out; what remains is persisting 'fullscreen' as a remembered
>    mode and honoring it in openTool/dock clicks.
> 3. Audit items: rescans gated on tool-open (live open / refresh on open /
>    idle closed); react-router major bump; Tauri fs $HOME scope narrowing;
>    CSP decision documented.
> FINDINGS standing: (a) File ▸ Print is window.print() and 16-print.css
>    hides every .page-sep overlay — printed output has NO page numbers/
>    headers/footers; PDF export is the numbered path. Fixing print = its
>    own project. (b) About ▸ Compatibility = runtime capability probes
>    (services/compat.ts): UUID/SubtleCrypto/Clipboard are always
>    "Latest" in the desktop app; the Storage row is the only
>    informative one. Recommended: fold into a Diagnostics surface or
>    trim — awaiting Derek's call.

Read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/HANDOFF.md` first for the durable footguns, the architecture
map, and Derek's working style. **This file is the fresh-chat catch-up**: the exact
commit/deploy workflow, what shipped in the last run, the best practices learned while
fixing this run's bugs, and where development stands — so a new session picks up without
re-deriving it. When it drifts, **rewrite it** (don't just append).

> Why this exists: chats grow long and slow. Starting fresh keeps each turn fast; this
> doc + `CLAUDE.md` carry everything forward.

## 0. THE WORKFLOW — how a change reaches Derek's Mac (read this first)

You are **not** editing Derek's Mac. You run in a **remote sandbox with its own fresh
clone**. The only channel to Derek is **git push**. He never copies files, never runs a
build — he runs **one command** and your pushed commits arrive.

**The contract, every single change:**

1. Edit files in this sandbox.
2. Run the gates (below). They must pass.
3. `git commit` with a clear message + the trailers (below).
4. `git push -u origin claude/v0_32`
5. End your delivery message with exactly:
   ```
   cd /Users/dcarl/ScriptCraft && npm run desktop
   ```

That's it. **`npm run desktop` = `git pull` → `npm install` (no-op unless deps changed) →
launch the Tauri app.** So the instant you've pushed to `claude/v0_32`, Derek runs that
one command and sees your change. If you didn't push, he gets nothing — pushing **is**
the deploy.

### Branch, remote, gotchas
- **Branch: `claude/v0_32`.** It is what Derek's clone tracks and what `npm run desktop`
  pulls. This is the current branch and its upstream is `origin/claude/v0_32`, so a plain
  `git push -u origin claude/v0_32` is all you need (single branch — no dual-push in this
  environment).
- **Remote in this environment is the `dac8767/ScriptCraft` path** (via the sandbox
  proxy) and it works. (An older handoff said the ScriptCraft path 403s and to use the
  `FreeScript` path — that was a *different* environment. Trust `git remote -v` in your
  own sandbox; here it's ScriptCraft and pushes succeed.)
- **Never commit to `main`** (stale v0.6 baseline). **Never force-push** `v0_32`.
- **Push retries:** on a network error, retry up to 4× with backoff (2s/4s/8s/16s).
- **Do NOT open a PR** unless Derek explicitly asks. The workflow is push-to-branch, not PR.
- **Model identity:** never put the model id in commits, code, changelog, or PR bodies —
  chat replies only. Commit trailers:
  ```
  Co-Authored-By: <the model trailer your environment instructions give>
  Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_...
  ```

### The gates — run before claiming anything works
```bash
cd frontend
npx tsc -b        # MUST be 0 errors. It gates the .dmg build; an unused import breaks the release.
npm test          # 605 tests as of this run, all green
npm run build     # tsc -b && vite build — must succeed
```
Bash resets to the repo root each call, so `cd frontend` every time (or chain with `&&`).
Write a real regression test for anything with logic — this repo's habit is "render it
and read back what it produced," which is how its worst bugs were caught.

### Versioning — the per-batch rule
Every shipped batch bumps `APP_VERSION` in `frontend/src/data/changelog.ts` and adds a
newest-first entry to `frontend/src/data/changelog.json` (the `changes: […]` string
shape) **in the same commit**, then gets its §1 section here. One batch = one version =
one changelog entry = one §1 section.

---

## 0.5 Multi-worker strategy — read `docs/WORKERS.md` (the playbook)

**Tier 1 (DEFAULT, proven): in-chat parallel workers.** The Dispatcher (this
chat) spawns N background subagents via the Agent tool — in ONE message so they
run concurrently — each with a tight brief on a disjoint lane. Workers never run
gates (concurrent tsc/vitest clobber shared state) and never commit; the
Dispatcher reviews diffs, runs the three gates once, live-verifies, commits,
pushes. Derek talks to one chat.

**Tier 2 (scale-out, use with care): fresh-session Routine spawns** — one at a
time, heartbeat-first prompts, standalone checkout preamble (fresh clones sit on
stale `main` with the WRONG CLAUDE.md), permissions via the committed
`.claude/settings.json`. The 2026-07-24 double-spawn produced two silently dead
sessions; `docs/WORKERS.md` has the derived operating rules. **Path B** (Derek
pastes briefs into chats himself) is the always-works fallback.

Lane infrastructure (all tiers): `docs/AREA-MAP.md` (lane map + spine),
`docs/lanes.json` (file→lane truth), `scripts/check-lanes.mjs`
(`npm run check-lanes`; `plan <lanes...>`; `--selftest` after edits),
`docs/EFFICIENCY-AUDIT.md` (cleanup backlog).

**Standing instruction:** when Derek queues more than one update, classify each
into a lane, run the planner, spawn Tier-1 workers for parallel-safe lanes, keep
spine work in the Dispatcher, and report the wave plan before starting.

---

## 0.6 Done phases — slicing, coverage, splits (history in HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md)

The editorStore slicing (10 domains; chrome deliberately deferred), the
safe-progress/coverage phase (suite 343 → 605 tests; the working-notes export
leak found & fixed across all four exporters; the workspaces apply root-cause)
and the first component splits are DONE. Their full write-ups moved verbatim to
`docs/HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md` (§0.6/§0.7) — read them there BEFORE reworking those
areas; the durable rules they produced live in CLAUDE.md §4 and §2 below.

Durable bits kept live here:
- Any test that (even transitively) imports `editorStore` needs
  `// @vitest-environment jsdom` (the store touches localStorage at import).
  Single-file `npx vitest run <file>` can resolve a cached vitest without jsdom
  and die with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND — re-run the full suite before believing a
  weird worker failure.
- Still open from those phases (needs Derek): his list of WHICH Design-panel
  options "never worked"; deliberate minor nits (odraft meta value-type
  validation, fonts loadFont failure-retry, templateCss selector escaping).

## 1. Where we are right now (end of this run)

> **STANDING RULE — start EVERY turn with `git fetch origin claude/v0_32 &&
> git log --oneline -1 origin/claude/v0_32`, and if local HEAD differs,
> `git reset --hard origin/claude/v0_32` BEFORE reading or editing anything.**
> The sandbox has now rolled back to a stale snapshot TWICE mid-session
> (v4.28-era files reappearing while origin was fine). Symptom: a file shows
> long-deleted code. The remote is the truth; pushes always survived.

> **STANDING SIZE CAP (2026-07-28 token-efficiency batch):** §1 keeps only
> the LAST 4–5 version sections fully written. When you add a new one, move
> the oldest kept section VERBATIM to the top of the version list in
> `docs/HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md` and add its one-liner to the index below. This
> file is read at the start of every fresh session — its length is a
> per-session tax. It was allowed to reach 2,559 lines; don't let it again.

### v5.51 — ribbon legacy-inserts retired, Filter right, pick BANNER, Navigator View menu (HEAD)

- Derek's 4 (mid-turn, after the v5.50 ship):
  (1) RIBBON RETIREMENT (phase 2's leading edge): Insert Section /
  Insert Note / Add To-Do List (builtins) + Insert Marker (command)
  removed — TOOLBAR_BUILTINS entries, Toolbar render cases,
  DEFAULT_TOOLBAR_LEFT tokens (and the orphaned r:def-3 rail),
  LEGACY_GROUP_ITEMS.insert → [], the insertMarker command +
  INSERT_CMDS palette slot. migrateDropLegacyInserts (toolbarBuiltins,
  the v3.25 shed pattern, flag 'opendraft:toolbarDropLegacyInserts551')
  strips saved layouts ONCE, both zones, 2!-flag-blind. The Insert MENU
  entries remain until phase 2 proper.
  (2) Annotations panel Filter: tool-ctl-lead dropped → rides right,
  just left of Search.
  (3) The PICK BANNER replaced the pick toast: a strip pinned above the
  scroll area — editor-center column child; .editor-main is a flex ROW,
  so a child there lands BESIDE the page (the first driver run caught
  the pill far-left) — pill centered, 15px, persistent until a
  selection lands; Escape cancels (the v5.48 listener).
  (4) NAVIGATOR VIEW MENU: the Scene # button became a ControlDropdown
  "View" with keep-open toggles — Scene Numbers (navShowSceneNumbers),
  Annotations, Scene Headings (navShowKinds.markup/.scene; missing =
  shown; the body honors JUST these two kinds again). Toggle handlers
  read the store AT CLICK TIME — two same-tick clicks through render
  closures clobbered each other (the driver caught it).
- check-v551: 11 green (fresh ribbon clean, persisted-layout shed with
  flag + undo kept, Filter gap 3px, banner top-center 15px persistent,
  Esc cancels, pick places + clears, Scene # gone, three menu items,
  scene rows 4→0, anno rows 1→0, both restored).
- QUEUED NEXT: the PAGES WINDOW TABS restructure (Script / Title Page /
  Custom; the separate Title Page tool leaves the side panels) — the
  batch opener for the next run.

### v5.50 — hide-ribbon CRASH fix, shared PerRowStepper, no-flash Design seat, Scrapbook auto-dock

- Derek's 6 (five mid-turn messages, one CRASH report):
  (1) THE CRASH ("when i tried to hide the ribbon toolbar"): three
  useEditorStore reads (dzVars + the two rib scale pcts, the v5.14
  per-kind geometry) sat ~900 lines BELOW Toolbar's
  `toolbarMode==='hidden'` early return — hiding the ribbon changed the
  hook count → 'Rendered fewer hooks'. Hoisted above the return beside
  the zone hooks (the file's own NOTE says exactly this; §4 footgun).
  Verified live: hide→restore, 0 pageerrors.
  (2) `.fs-perrow-input` wears `.tool-action-field` (standard border +
  dark input bg) at 30px, margin -4px → ~2px off the arrow frame.
  (3) The # button tooltip: "Go to page #".
  (4) ONE PerRowStepper (ToolControls) — framed Up/Down + typeable
  field; Pages AND Scenes-Cards render it (CircleMinus/Plus gone from
  ScenesTool; the count-span/perRowText inline versions deleted).
  (5) Design FLASH on open (far-left frame): the seat effect became
  useLayoutEffect — seats before first paint.
  (6) SCRAPBOOK AUTO-DOCK: NotebookSurface mount, when
  toolConfig.notebook is disabled, enables it into the LEFT panel
  (docked, activeTool) and remembers the prior cfg; unmount restores it
  verbatim. Probe: rows 0 → 1 (left, active) → 0 with cfg restored.
- Probes (inline, no check file — every piece store+DOM-verified live):
  pages type-5, scenes framed stepper type-4 + 0 old icons, auto-dock
  cycle, hidden-ribbon toggle crash-free.
- QUEUED NEXT (Derek, this turn — in order): ribbon retirement of
  Insert Section / Insert Note / Add To-Do List / Insert Marker
  (builtins+palette+default layout+one-time shed; RIBBON_HIDE precedent);
  Annotations-panel Filter right-aligned before Search (drop
  tool-ctl-lead); the pick-to-place prompt as a BIG persistent centered
  banner at the editor top (Escape cancels — listener exists);
  Navigator: Scene # toggle → a "View" menu (Scene Number / Annotations
  / Scene Heading toggles — reuse navShowKinds for scene+markup);
  PAGES WINDOW TABS (Script / Title Page / Custom) with the separate
  Title Page tool leaving the side panels — the big restructure.

### v5.49 — Design seats at the panel edge, stacked previews + Save, picker ×/white chips, spinner + typeable count

- Derek's 8 (five mid-turn messages; the sandbox rolled back a FOURTH
  time at turn start — reset + reinstall recovered it, and the restored
  node_modules was MISSING the tiptap extension packages until
  `npm install` reran):
  (1) DESIGN SEAT SPEC (his correction of v5.48's top-right anchor):
  every OPEN of the independent window seats it against its OWN panel —
  right edge on the right panel's left edge (mirrored for a left-side
  config), measured live from `.tool-dock-wrap.tool-dock-<side>`;
  no visible panel → top-right fallback. Drags while open are
  respected; the v5.48 sentinel/off-screen logic is gone.
  (2) PREVIEWS STACKED: "In Script:" UNDER "In Navigator:", both left
  (.markup-prev-lines column, .markup-prev-line rows); SAVE moved into
  the same section, pinned bottom-right (.markup-pop-preview align-items
  flex-end + margin-left auto); the .markup-pop-foot row + spacer are
  dead, removed.
  (3) Highlight group hugs the head row's right (.markup-hl-group
  margin-left auto — keeps right-hugging when wrapped).
  (4) The icon/color picker's drag bar gained a × (.markup-icon-pop-close,
  stopPropagation vs the drag).
  (5) WHITE CHIPS: `.markup-preset` background is #fff app-wide (the
  paper the margin icons ride) — the isDarkColor light-chip special case
  is now redundant-but-harmless (class + rule remain).
  (6) STEPPER: one frame around both arrows (.fs-updown bordered,
  divider between buttons), number snug (-3px against the group gap)…
  (7) …and the count is a FIELD (.fs-perrow-input — type it or step it;
  raw text while editing, blur snaps to the clamped store value;
  reverses v5.08's "never typed").
- check-v549: 11 green (fresh + post-dock-cycle seat gap 8px, stacked
  left-aligned previews, Save bottom-right + foot gone, highlight
  right-hug 0px, picker × present/closes, 57/57 white chips, framed
  tight arrows, 3px number gap, typed 6 → store+grid 6).

### v5.48 — annotations = highlighted text, pick-to-place, title-bar status/delete, Scene # in header

- Derek's 8 (six mid-turn messages):
  (1) EVERY annotation anchors to highlighted TEXT: createMarkupAtSelection
  with an EMPTY selection creates NOTHING — it arms
  markupsSlice.markupCreatePick (+ a toast prompt) and the next selection
  in the script places the annotation (the Link Script Text flow promoted
  to the front door; listener hosted in MarkupIconLayer, Escape stands
  down). A cursor INSIDE an existing highlight opens that annotation.
  Point annotations are no longer creatable; legacy ones stay readable
  (their Link Script Text upgrade path remains). convertMarkupToPoint is
  GONE with the remove-highlight button. Return type is now
  `string | null`.
  (2) The window's ⋮ MENU IS GONE (superseding the just-asked move-to-
  header mid-batch): the title bar carries a STATUS toggle
  (.markup-win-status, FaRegCheckCircle, green when done) and DELETE
  (.markup-win-delete) which confirmDialog-warns, then does the ⋮ menu's
  exact delete (removeMarkupFromDoc + emit + removeMarkup + close).
  MarkupDotsMenu remains on panel cards + Navigator rows.
  (3) Preview icons CENTERED on their labels (.markup-pop-preview
  align-items center; nav preview inline-flex).
  (4) NAVIGATOR: the Scene # toggle moved into the window HEADER — text
  only (.fs-nav-nums-ctl, .tool-ctl.active = accent); NavActionRow and
  its CSS are gone.
  (5) DESIGN POP-OUT SEAT (Derek's screenshot: half off-screen): the
  dock-drag left `pos` at the panel edge and reopening used it. dockInto
  resets pos to the sentinel; the open effect ALSO re-anchors whenever
  the remembered spot is mostly off-viewport.
- check-v548: 12 green (empty add → armed+toast+no create, Escape
  cancels, next selection places a highlighted range annotation with the
  mark in the doc, no hl-del / no ⋮ / status+delete present, status
  toggles+lights, chip centered Δ0, cancel keeps, confirmed delete
  removes annotation+span+window, selected add unchanged, dock-cycle
  pop-out fully on screen).

### v5.47 — # goto in header, stacked stepper, Design DOCKS BACK, notes checklist fixes, edit-window force-show

- Derek's 10 (seven mid-turn messages; the sandbox ALSO rolled back a
  THIRD time at turn start — reset + npm install + Vite restart, the
  standing recovery):
  (1) GO TO PAGE → the window HEADER: PagesControls gains a bare
  `#` button (`.fs-pages-goto-btn`, FaHashtag, shares the
  .tool-ctl-search-btn sizing rule) LEFT of the search; its pop asks
  "Go to page #:". The jump crosses components via
  sceneNavSlice.pagesGotoRequest (chrome REQUESTS, the body — owner of
  the grid ref + editor — performs and clears; the slice's own
  chrome/body precedent). The body row's goto form + gotoPage state are
  gone.
  (2) STEPPER: `.fs-updown` — Up stacked on Down, LEFT of the number
  (− / + retired; CircleMinus/PlusIcon imports dropped here — the
  Scenes cards stepper keeps its own).
  (3) DESIGN DOCKS BACK (Derek: "i can no longer add the design window
  back into the side panel" — the v5.46 hole): the independent window's
  header drag got the v4.39 drop-on-panel gesture (zones + drop-target
  highlight + dockInto: setToolConfig side, setToolMode 'docked',
  designPanelOpen false, openTool). openTool('design') honors an
  EXPLICIT docked home (cfg.enabled && toolMode.design==='docked' →
  falls through to the docked-slot branch), else independent window.
  migrateDesignToolMode (editorStore, viewState.designModeReset flag)
  strips a LEGACY pre-v5.46 'docked' ONCE so upgrades don't resurrect
  the slot-stealing v5.46 removed. The dock-row drag-out for design
  hands back to the independent window (mode 'floating', closeTool +
  openTool), never the old slot-float frame.
  (4) NOTES CHECKLIST CARET: `.swn-note-editor` task rows lacked the
  annotation editor's `li > div { flex: 1 }` — the empty text div was
  ZERO-width, so clicks beside the box missed the editable area. Fixed
  (+ label flex-shrink 0).
  (5) NOTES HELPER TEXT gone: the Placeholder extension removed from
  StickyCard's NoteBody (+ its CSS); the title field's placeholder
  stays.
  (6) NO STRIKETHROUGH on checked items — Notes AND annotation editor
  (line-through dropped, the dim color/opacity kept).
  (7) ICON ROW: MarkupUsedRow's separate current-swatch + `+` trigger
  merged — MarkupComboPicker's trigger IS the current combo
  (`.markup-combo-current`); .markup-combo-plus CSS retired.
  (8) EDIT-WINDOW FORCE-SHOW: while markupEditorId != null the script
  shows ALL annotations — an OVERRIDE, never a write: the page's
  `markups-hidden` class condition, MarkupIconLayer's layer gates AND
  its scriptFiltered() all stand down while open; closing reverts to
  the stored preference untouched.
  (9) tooltip: "Delete highlight (the annotation stays)" → "Remove
  highlight from script". (10) (batch hygiene: mixed-escape MenuBar-
  style edits again needed python splices; .swn mini bar is
  :focus-within-gated — the driver must click INTO the field first.)
- check-v547: 21 green (bare # left of search, pop label, jump from
  pos 1 → page 2 + request cleared, stacked geometry + left-of-count +
  − / + gone, up/down 3→4→3, window-drop docks + row click honors home
  + row drag-out returns to the window, no [data-placeholder], div
  fills row + caret lands beside the box, no strikethrough ×2,
  force-show with toggle off + revert on close, new tooltip, + gone /
  current combo opens picker).

### Older versions — one line each (full sections in `docs/HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md`)

Newest first. When a version rolls out of the detailed set above, its section
moves verbatim to the archive and its line lands here.

- **v5.46** — nav Filter=annotation grid, Design independent window, edge resize everywhere, live checklist, working inserts
- **v5.45** — AI Writer: panel-only remove button, out of the Tools menu; Pages header right pair

- **v5.38** — Scenes cards: metrics wrap to a second row instead of truncating the name
- **v5.37** — fullscreen joins the one-window rule; the annotation window never coexists with a takeover
- **v5.36** — Notes v2: one rich card kind, equal-height rows, the WebKit drag-abort fix
- **v5.35** — docked side-panel tools survive clicks into the script (floats/temp still dismiss)
- **v5.34** — the Scenes "Reorder" button reads "Change Order"
- **v5.33** — icon-anchored seating, resizable windows, real scrapbook links, nav list rows, titlebar ⋮, Displays-as preview
- **v5.32** — one-row nav header (blue body buttons), unmistakable active icon, Design exempt both ways
- **v5.31** — highlight delete/link conversions, inline Used row, combined icon+color picker
- **v5.30** — the edit window becomes a WINDOW (drag/fullscreen/× + own theme); tool locked to panel
- **v5.29** — picker Used sections, legible chips, one-row popover head, icon import
- **v5.28** — annotation view controls everywhere (View submenu, ribbon menu) + navigator polish
- **v5.27** — solid icons, colored rings, segmented toggles, FaMarker identity
- **v5.26** — ANNOTATIONS: rename + the 14-item polish batch (block anchors, swatch pickers, auto-icon)
- **v5.25** — MARKUPS: the annotation tool is born (store/mark/popover/panel/presets)
- **v5.24** — columns not rows, the drag that never started, tab washes
- **v5.23** — compact buttons, the anchored-resize truth, per-row right
- **v5.22** — Sticky Notes: one interleaved list, reorderable tabs, blank check row
- **v5.21** — the seven-pack: Sticky Notes merge, fullscreen Title Page, one window, and the zombie Window menu
- **v5.20** — the Scenes four-pack: contained popover, Cards per row, one menu, lighter cards
- **v5.19** — Reorder wears the dialogs' Apply format
- **v5.18** — per-row button spacing; the box-air truth
- **v5.17** — padding grows the bar; the descender truth
- **v5.16** — 0 means 0; bar side-padding knobs
- **v5.15** — the ribbon Design reorg, and the 1px lie
- **v5.14** — per-kind ribbon geometry
- **v5.13** — title page out of Pages; the Design field you can type in
- **v5.12** — the table↔caret line is Derek's slider
- **v5.11** — caret-only again, but a caret you can hit
- **v5.10** — the whole row is the caret
- **v5.09** — narrow Scenes fold behind a caret; the isolate:false lesson
- **v5.08** — Pages controls say what they mean
- **v5.07** — resize bars split the difference
- **v5.06** — a column is what the eye groups
- **v5.05** — where an element SITS is its format
- **v5.04** — "clicking it doesn't do anything"
- **v5.03** — resizable scene columns; the full-screen close bug
- **v5.02** — the Scenes list is a TABLE

### Standing release blockers (unchanged; from CLAUDE.md §6 / HANDOFF.md §5)
Brand art (`src-tauri/icons/`, splash, favicon); Apple Developer + signing identity in
`build-desktop.sh`; rehost `languageCatalog.ts` dictionaries off Proteus's CDN; Courier
Prime + dictionary licenses; trademark clearance on "ScriptCraft"; `macos-private-api` is
on ⇒ no Mac App Store (the signed-`.dmg` plan); rotate the embedded GitHub PAT.

## 2. Best practices & footguns learned THIS run (add to the ones in CLAUDE.md §4)

These each cost a bug. They're specific to what this run touched.

- **Assets on desktop can't be `fetch()`ed.** Derek runs the Tauri SQLite backend, whose
  `getAssetUrl` returns a `convertFileSrc` `asset://…` URL — the webview loads it fine via
  `<img src>` but **cannot `fetch()` it**, so a blob-loader that fetched the URL showed a
  broken "!". Fix pattern, now the rule: **every storage backend exposes `getAssetBytes`;
  load bytes → `URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([bytes]))`.** Works on desktop *and* web.
  `AssetImage` / `AssetAudio` in `CharacterProfiles.tsx` are the reference.
- **Two lists that drift = the Remove bug.** The character panel drew names from the
  store's `characters` list, which goes stale the instant a cue is deleted
  (`updateCharacters` only re-runs when the cursor leaves a character node). So a deleted
  profile got resurrected. Fix, and the general rule: **derive from one fresh source.** The
  panel now scans the live doc (`scriptCharacterNames`) as the single source of "who's in
  the script"; the stale store list is not a source for it. (This is CLAUDE.md's
  single-source-of-truth rule biting in practice — believe it.)
- **Flex `flex: 0 0 auto` moves the shrink pressure, it doesn't remove it.** Making ribbon
  sections non-shrinking (so the bar scrolls instead of squishing) meant *all* the
  narrow-window shrink fell on the separators (still `flex-shrink: 1`) → they collapsed to
  0 width and the dividers vanished. **When you pin one set of flex children, pin the
  siblings that must keep their size too.** Now both sections and separators are
  `flex: 0 0 auto`; nothing shrinks, the bar scrolls.
- **Ribbon overflow model:** the toolbar used to hide low-priority sections into a "…"
  menu on narrow widths (that reads as "squishing"). It now **scrolls horizontally**
  (`overflow-x: auto` + non-shrinking children). The overflow menu is kept **only** for
  genuinely CSS-hidden (mobile-only, `offsetWidth === 0`) items so those stay reachable on
  phones. Don't reintroduce width-based hiding.
- **Making a floating window dockable = extract a body, share it.** Pattern used three
  times this run (Design, Workspaces, Feedback): pull the panel's guts into a
  `…Body`/`…Docked` component with no chrome, render it from both the floating window and a
  new `ToolDock` case, so the two entry points can't drift. To register a dockable tool:
  add the id to `ToolId` (`stores/editorStore.ts`), add an `ALL_TOOLS` entry + a render
  `case` in `ToolDock.tsx`; it then appears in **Customize > Side Panels** automatically
  (it's built from `ALL_TOOLS` minus `PANEL_EXCLUDED_IDS`). Give width-hungry surfaces
  `noPanelFit: true` so they open floating but still pop-in-dock.
- **Portalled toolbar slot = line one panel's controls up with another's.** The
  relationship map's action bar renders via `createPortal` into a `.char-rels-toolbar`
  `<div>` that CharacterProfiles owns (passed as `headerSlot`), so the map's Fit/Add
  buttons sit in the *same place and style* as the list view's toolbar. A `useState`
  element + ref-callback is the wiring (`setMapHeaderSlot`).
- **File-tab CSS trick:** tabs get `border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0`, `margin-bottom: -1px` to
  overlap the track's bottom border, and the **active** tab gets
  `border-bottom: 1px solid <content-bg>` (here `--fd-navigator-bg`) to *mask* the track
  line so it visually merges with the panel below. That's what makes them read as real
  tabs, not underlined text.
- **Design tokens are gated by a test.** Each token in `design/designTokens.ts` must have
  `def` equal to the CSS `var(--x, <fallback>)` literal it drives (a unit test enforces
  it). New knob this run: `charFieldGap` / `--dz-char-field-gap`, def `8`, and every CSS
  use writes `var(--dz-char-field-gap, 8px)`. Keep them in lockstep or `npm test` fails.
- **Persisted character data rides the whole profile object.** `voiceProfile`,
  `customFields`, etc. persist automatically because `_characterProfiles` serializes the
  full `characterProfiles` array (save sites in `ScreenplayEditor.tsx` +
  `MenuBar.tsx`; load spreads the full object; `collabSync` syncs the whole array). Add a
  field to the `CharacterProfile` type and it just persists — no per-field plumbing.

## 3. Architecture pointers for what this run touched

| File | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `components/CharacterProfiles.tsx` | The character tool. Tabs (`activeTab`: profiles/relationships/setup), `relViewMode` (list/map), `AssetImage`/`AssetAudio`, name-rewrite-into-script, Setup tab, custom fields. Big file — the whole tool. |
| `components/RelationshipMap.tsx` | SVG force-graph. Its toolbar (Fit + Add Relationship) **portals into `headerSlot`**; pan/zoom hint is a bottom-left corner overlay. |
| `components/ToolDock.tsx` | `ALL_TOOLS` registry + the render `switch`. Add dockable tools here. `WINDOW_IDS`, `PANEL_EXCLUDED_IDS`. |
| `components/DesignPanel.tsx` | `DesignPanelBody` (shared guts) + `DesignPanelDocked` + the floating `DesignPanel`. |
| `components/WorkspacesTool.tsx`, `FeedbackTool.tsx` | The new dockable tools. Feedback reads `data/helpForms.ts`. |
| `components/Toolbar.tsx` + `styles/screenplay/03-toolbar.css` | The ribbon. Overflow → scroll logic in `measure()`; `.rib-section` / `.toolbar-separator` are `flex: 0 0 auto`. |
| `stores/editorStore.ts` | `ToolId` (add dockable ids here), `CharacterProfile` type, character store actions. ~2.6k lines. |
| `design/designTokens.ts` | Design-knob registry; `def` must equal the CSS var fallback. |
| `styles/screenplay/10-character-profiles.css` | All character-tool styling. |

**The stylesheet is already split** into `styles/screenplay/NN-*.css` area files (that
was the long-planned `screenplay.css` split; it happened). Character = `10-…`, toolbar =
`03-…`, tools-extra = `22-…`, design panel = `26-…`, toolbar-zones = `23-…`.

## 4. UI verification — USE THE KIT (speed audit 2026-07-28)

**Start from `frontend/devtools/driver.mjs`** — launch/boot/seedScript/openTool/
fullscreen/waitScenes/shot, all event-waited. Derek timed the old way at 11
minutes per small update; the kit reaches the same verified state **31× faster**
(measured 108.4s → 3.5s, `devtools/bench-boot.mjs` reproduces it). The rules
live in `docs/SPEED-AUDIT-2026-07-28.md` §3; the short form:

- **Never type a fixture** — `seedScript()` injects the whole document through
  the DEV-only `window.__scEditor` handle (ScreenplayEditor, DEV builds only).
- **Never `waitForTimeout` on a guess** — wait on a named condition.
- **One driver run prints every number** you need; re-running is ~4s but the
  habit matters.
- Iterate with `npx vitest related <files> --run` (~3s); the **full suite once,
  before commit** (~12s since `isolate: false`; if a failure smells like
  cross-file leakage, re-check with `--isolate`).
- Driver scripts and fixtures live in `frontend/devtools/`, IN THE REPO — a
  rollback wiped the scratchpad copies mid-audit.

Environment facts that still hold:
- Chromium at `executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`; dev server
  `npx vite --port 5199` (curl-poll for 200). Don't run `playwright install`.
- Startup dialogs block the UI — `boot()` Escapes them; clicking **Create** on
  the New Script dialog also works if you drive by hand.
- Open Customize via `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('scriptcraft:command', { detail: 'customize' }))`.
- Seed chrome state via `localStorage['opendraft:viewState']` in `addInitScript`;
  to keep a seeded ribbon verbatim, also set the one-time migration flags
  (`opendraft:toolbar*NNN`).
- Tools render **inline** by default (`.tool-inline-*`); clicking `.ProseMirror`
  **minimizes** an open tool window (by design).

## 5. Derek, in one paragraph

Sole product owner and tester; tests each build on his Mac and reports back. Wants **root
cause, not patches**; **one source of truth** for anything that appears twice; **no silent
no-ops**; honest risk assessment (defer with a reason, own mistakes plainly). He renames
things constantly — rename everywhere, immediately. Icons are monotone line-style, never
emoji in UI chrome. Never comment on the time of day. He iterates fast on visual
placement, so a reasonable attempt he can correct beats stalling — **but** don't invent
*content/behavior* decisions (a genre taxonomy, what a new control does); ask for those.
End every delivery with `cd /Users/dcarl/ScriptCraft && npm run desktop`.
