## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OpenDraft.git

## Development Workflow

Run the backend and frontend dev servers in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend (with auto-reload)
./start_backend.sh

# Terminal 2: Frontend (with hot-reload)
./start_frontend.sh
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
