/**
 * UpdateBanner (v7.62) — "a newer build exists", and a way to go get it.
 *
 * Derek is about to hand the app to a handful of testers, and the failure mode
 * that matters is not a broken updater — it is a tester quietly running a
 * three-week-old build and reporting bugs that were fixed a fortnight ago.
 * This is the smallest thing that stops that.
 *
 * NOTIFY ONLY, on purpose. See services/updateCheck.ts for why installing waits
 * for a Developer ID.
 *
 * TWO CHECKS, TWO DIFFERENT MANNERS — the distinction is the whole design:
 *
 *   The AUTOMATIC one (on launch) is silent unless it has good news. Offline,
 *   DNS down, manifest missing: say nothing. A writer opening a script on a
 *   train has not asked about updates and must not be told the network failed.
 *
 *   The MANUAL one (Help ▸ Check for Updates…) must ALWAYS answer, including
 *   "you're up to date" and including the error. Someone who asked a question
 *   and got silence back cannot tell a working check from a broken one — which
 *   is the same silent no-op this app treats as the cardinal sin, wearing a
 *   network error as a disguise.
