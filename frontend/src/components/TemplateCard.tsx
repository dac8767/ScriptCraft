/**
 * TemplateCard — THE row for a formatting template, wherever one is listed.
 *
 * v7.50, Derek, pointing at the Format ▸ Script Format / Template window: "this
 * is the window that should be duplicated in the setting > page setup tab. use
 * the window shown in the screenshot, and add the view button. keep the
 * shown/hidden section below this."
 *
 * "Duplicated" is the one thing this must NOT be. Two lists of the same
 * templates, drawn by two functions, is the exact shape of nearly every bug in
 * this project's history — a menu icon map that stopped matching its menu, a
 * card copied instead of shared. Settings ▸ Page Setup had its own row markup
 * (`pst-listrow`, a "Default" chip, its own action buttons) and the dialog had
 * `renderTemplateItem`; they had already drifted — one showed the mode badge
 * and which template was CURRENT, the other showed neither. So this is one
 * component and both lists render it.
 *
 * WHAT VARIES BETWEEN THE TWO PLACES is exactly what is a prop, and each
 * follows the same rule the v7.49 Cancel followed: AN AFFORDANCE EXISTS IF AND
 * ONLY IF THERE IS SOMETHING FOR IT TO DO, never because a boolean somewhere
 * says a context's name.
 *
 *   · onSelect — the dialog picks a template to Apply; the Settings tab is a
 *     management list where clicking a row means nothing. No handler, so the
 *     row is not clickable and never paints as selected.
 *   · onView — opens that template's page setup. Only the Settings tab has
 *     somewhere for that to go.
 *
 * Duplicate/Edit/Delete behave identically in both, which is the whole point,
 * so they live here rather than being passed in: duplicating a BUILT-IN opens
 * the editor on the copy (there is nothing else you could want — the original
 * is immutable), duplicating a custom one just makes the copy.

     stopPropagation on the CONTAINER holding the buttons, and that container
     is the full width of the card. The buttons occupy the first ~50px of it;
     the other ~1,150px is empty strip that was swallowing clicks. Everything
