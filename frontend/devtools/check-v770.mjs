/* check-v770 — the app ships with Derek's setup as its defaults.
 *
 *   "this is the the full presets file. everything in this file should be made
 *    the default setting. the workspaces should have 5 options, all of which
 *    should be included as default, non deletable options. if this file does
 *    not include 5 workspace options, rework the preset exports so it does
 *    include all workspaces"
 *
 * The export already carried all five, so nothing about the export changed.
 * What is new is that a fresh install now opens as his app — and that the five
 * are permanent: seeded once for a new profile, merged back on EVERY load for
 * a profile that predates this version, and refused by both the store and the
 * two lists that draw the buttons when something tries to delete or rename one.
 *
 * Three things this has to prove beyond "the keys are there":
 *   • it NEVER overwrites — a setting the user has already chosen survives the
 *     seed, or shipping this version would wipe Derek's own app;
 *   • it never REORDERS — forcing the five to the top would undo Edit
 *     Workspaces' up/down arrows on the next restart, which is a silent no-op
 *     with a delay on it;
 *   • the five read CLEAN the moment they are applied. His export predates
 *     v7.69, so its snapshots hold 19 of the 33 fields a snapshot carries now,
 *     and workspaceIsDirty compares key for key — untouched, all five would
 *     have shown "Save Changes to this Workspace" lit forever.
