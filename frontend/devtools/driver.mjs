// devtools/driver.mjs — shared Playwright driver kit (speed audit, 2026-07-28)
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Derek: "this is getting very slow again. the last few small
// updates took 11 minutes." The audit (docs/SPEED-AUDIT-2026-07-28.md) traced
// most of that to the verification drivers, each hand-written per check and
// each paying the same tax:
//
//   1. TYPING the fixture script through the UI — 30–110 lines at keystroke
//      granularity, ~30–60s per run. Fixed by injection: ScreenplayEditor
//      exposes the TipTap instance as window.__scEditor in DEV builds, and
//      seedScript() hands it a whole document at once.
//   2. FIXED WAITS — waitForTimeout(4000) after boot plus 6–9 scattered
//      600–2000ms sleeps. Fixed with event-driven waits on real conditions.
//   3. REBUILDING THE KIT — drivers lived in the session scratchpad, which
//      sandbox rollbacks wipe (it happened mid-audit). This kit lives in the
//      repo. It is dev tooling: outside src/, invisible to tsc, vitest and
//      the release build.
//
// Usage (from frontend/, with Vite on :5199):
//   import { launch, boot, seedScript, openTool, fullscreen, SCENES_4 } from './devtools/driver.mjs';
//   const { browser, page } = await launch();
//   await boot(page);                    // app up, dialogs cleared
//   await seedScript(page, SCENES_4);    // whole script injected in one call
//   await openTool(page, 'Scenes');
//   ... assertions ...
//   await browser.close();

    /* v7.15 — THE SECOND-INSTANCE TRAP, made impossible to fall into.
       A check that wants the app's live module writes
       `await window.__scImport('/src/services/api.ts')`, never a bare
       `import('/src/services/api.ts')`.

       Why: Vite stamps an invalidated module with a cache-buster, so a dev
       server that has seen ANY edit serves the app
       `/src/services/api.ts?t=1786775615204` while a bare import gets
       `/src/services/api.ts` — a SECOND copy of the module, with its own
       state. check-v673 patched api.getVersions on that copy, the panel went
       on calling the real one, and the check failed in a way that looked
       like a regression in Script History. The same trap silently WEAKENS a
       check instead of failing it whenever the second copy is only read
       from: it answers about a module nothing on screen is using.

       Resolving through the resource timings means we import the exact URL
       the app imported, and throwing when there is no entry means a check
       can never quietly get a private copy instead. The buffer holds 250
       entries by default and the app loads more modules than that, so it is
       raised here — before any of them load. */
