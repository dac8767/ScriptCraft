/* check-version-sync (v7.62, hardened v7.63) — the app's version and every
 * shipped copy of it must be the same number, and that number must be one the
 * build can actually parse.
 *
 * They were not. The app said 7.61; src-tauri/tauri.conf.json said 0.19.0, and
 * nothing connected them — release.yml reads the git tag into $VERSION and uses
 * it for the release NOTES only, never writing it into the config. So every
 * build since v0.19 was stamped 0.19.0 whatever the About box claimed, and the
 * .dmg filename disagreed with the app inside it.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A NOTE. It is invisible from inside the app: the
 * About box reads APP_VERSION and is always right, so nothing on screen ever
 * looks wrong. It only surfaces at release time, in an artifact, after the tag
 * is cut — and it is precisely what an updater compares, so the first thing
 * built on top of it would have compared 0.19.0 against 0.19.0 and concluded
 * forever that there was nothing to install.
 *
 * ── v7.63, and the reason this file grew ──────────────────────────────────
 * The v7.62 fix wrote APP_VERSION through verbatim: `"version": "7.62"`. Tauri
 * requires full semver and refuses two components outright —
 *
 *     failed to parse config: `tauri.conf.json > version` must be a semver string
 *
 * — so the app would not launch AT ALL. This file passed it, because the only
 * shape assertion it made was on APP_VERSION (`\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?`, which permits
 * two parts) and never on the value actually written into the config.
 *
 * That is the lesson worth keeping: the check tested the INPUT and not the
 * ARTIFACT. Tauri's parser is the real authority and it cannot run here, so
 * every assertion below is about the written file, in the shape that parser
 * demands.
 *
 * Fix drift with:  node devtools/sync-version.mjs
