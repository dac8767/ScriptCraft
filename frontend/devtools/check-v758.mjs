/* check-v758 — four suggestions from the feedback queue.
 *
 *   1. "shift the add button right so it is next to the Show all button"
 *   2. "move teh reset buttons so they are each under their respective
 *       section. we do not need the 'Reset ores and continues' button at all"
 *   3. "restructure this so it has the standard Shown and Hidden columns. If
 *       something is moved to the shown column, it appears in the toolbar
 *       above. we no longer need the ability to drag items from this window
 *       directly onto the toolbar"
 *   4. "for these grayed out items, show 'This feature is still in
 *       development' when hovering over them with the cursor"
 *
 * ── 4 is a bug wearing a suggestion's clothes, and the interesting kind.
 *
 * v7.06 already gave those items that tooltip. It had never once been seen,
 * because `.menu-dropdown-item.disabled` carried `pointer-events: none` — the
 * browser delivers no hover to such an element, and a native title tooltip is
 * hover or nothing. So the feature was written, shipped, and silently inert
 * for fifty versions. Nothing in the source looked wrong: the title is right
 * there on the element.
 *
 * Which is why the assertions below refuse to accept `getAttribute('title')`
 * as evidence. That passed the whole time. They check the property that
 * actually decides whether a human ever sees it — that the element is
 * hit-testable — and they check it on the item Derek pointed at.
 *
 * ── 3 is the largest change: the last tab that did not speak the app's own
 * language. Checked by driving the real list and reading the STORE, because
 * the whole claim is "the Shown column is the toolbar" — a column that
 * rendered the right rows while writing nowhere would look identical.
 *
 * ── 1 and 2 are arrangement, so they are measured by position. A button keeps
 * its class, label and handler while sitting in the wrong place.

   section-title row field, the spacer and dropdown width fields, and the
   absence of the in-place bar editor.

   Derek: "revert the ribbon toolbar window back to before I asked you to split
   it into the shown+hidden columns." The tab is the palette-plus-live-bar
   editor again, so every assertion here describes a screen that no longer
   exists. Removed rather than left to fail or, worse, quietly rewritten to
   pass — a check whose subject was withdrawn should say so and stop, not
   linger asserting something adjacent.

   The tab's own behaviour is covered by the checks that always covered it:
   check-v683 (live on-ribbon editing, dropdown resize, dividers, alignment)
   and check-v716 (the editor renders at the same size as the live bar).

   The other three parts of this file stand — the greyed-menu-item fix, the
   header adders, and the Editor tab's per-section resets are all unrelated to
   the tab's shape and none of them was withdrawn. */
