 * Derek: "this is the the full presets file. everything in this file should be
 * made the default setting."
 *
 * ALMOST everything. A preset export is a snapshot of ONE person's app on ONE
 * machine, and a handful of its keys are his rather than the product's. Baked
 * in as defaults they would each do real damage on a stranger's computer, so
 * they are dropped HERE, by name, with the reason attached — not quietly
 * skipped somewhere in the app.
 *
 * Re-run this whenever he sends a newer export; the exclusions travel with it.
