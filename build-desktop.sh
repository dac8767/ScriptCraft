# ScriptCraft — Desktop Build Script (.dmg distribution)
# Builds, signs, and notarizes the app for direct download distribution.
#
# Tauri handles signing and notarization automatically when the correct
# environment variables are set. Credentials are loaded from .env.
#
#   ./build-desktop.sh            release: signed + notarized (needs Apple creds)
#   ./build-desktop.sh --local    LOCAL install, unsigned, no Apple account
#
# v7.31, why --local exists. Derek could not test whether double-clicking a
# .script file opens the app: macOS reads file associations from Info.plist,
# which is written at BUILD time, and `tauri dev` never installs a bundle at
# all — so a dev session can never register one. The only way to test it is an
# installed .app, and requiring a notarized build (which needs an Apple
# Developer membership that is still an open release blocker) made testing an
# OS-level behaviour impossible for the person who owns the app.
# An unsigned local build registers associations on your own machine exactly
# like a signed one. Gatekeeper will refuse the FIRST launch — right-click the
# app and choose Open, once. It is not for distribution.
