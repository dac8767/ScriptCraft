/**
 * brand-sweep (v7.15) — Derek, queued 2026-08-14: "look through all code and
 * make sure any instance of 'Freedraft' or 'OpenDraft' are removed (excluding
 * the about page which actually talks about OpenDraft) and replaced with
 * ScriptCraft."
 *
 * A blanket find-replace would break the app, so this sweeps PROSE only and
 * refuses to touch anything that names a thing:
 *
 *  · `opendraft:…`      — 224 localStorage keys. Renaming orphans every
 *                         setting, workspace, theme and layout Derek has.
 *  · `.odraft`          — the file format. Renaming orphans saved scripts.
 *  · `com.freedraft.*`  — the bundle id: the app's identity to macOS.
 *  · `OPENDRAFT_*`      — env vars a running deployment reads.
 *  · slugs and filenames (opendraft-collab, OpenDraft-intro.mp4, …) — real
 *    services, volumes, GCP projects and files on disk.
 *
 * Run `node devtools/brand-sweep.mjs --check` to fail when a NEW prose mention
 * appears; that check runs in check-all so this can't silently come back.
